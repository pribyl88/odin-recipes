        <h2>About this recipe:</h2>
        <p>This is the section of recipe sites that usually drabs on and on about the background of the recipe so they can cram as many ads as possible into their content and maximize revenue.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 (scant) cup almond flour</li>
            <li>1.5 cups coconut sugar or light brown sugar</li>
            <li>0.5 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 packet of vanilla pudding powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp flaky sea salt</li>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter (melted)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs (room temperature)</li>
            <li>1 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>15 oz milk chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375ÂºF.</li>
            <li>Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Whisk together all dry ingredients EXCEPT the flaky sea salt.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients.</li>
            <li>Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients bit-by-bit until well-mixed.</li>
            <li>Add the milk chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough and roll them into balls using your palms.</li>
            <li>Arrange your balled-up-dough on your baking sheet, leaving room for expansion.</li>
            <li>Bake until edges are golden-brown but centers look slightly under-baked (they'll continue cooking once out of the oven); likely 10-12 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven & sprinkle with flaky salt.</li>
            <li>Cool on pan for at least two minutes, then transfer to cooling rack to finish cooling.</li>
            <li>Put them in your mouth & chew. We'll stop there but the <a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/digestive-system-how-it-works" target="_blank">National Institute of Health</a> would be more than happy to walk you through the rest of the process if curiosity gets the best of you.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>PRO TIP:</strong> Give some to strangers and they'll want to be your friend 90%+ of the time. Wield this new superpower responsibly.</p>
